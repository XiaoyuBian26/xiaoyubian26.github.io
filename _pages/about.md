Welcome to my website! I am a PhD Candidate in Economics at The Chinese University of Hong Kong.

My research interests span economic history, political economy, development economics, and labor economics. My current research focuses on the impact of agricultural expansion on environmental degradation and economic growth, including its direct economic promoting effects and the medium-to-long-term offsetting effects stemming from negative environmental externalities in the context of the intense population-farmland conflict and upland maize cultivation in the Ming â€“ Qing periods.  I am adept in using spatial geographic network analysis (R and ArcGIS) to explore my current topics. You can download my CV [here](../assets/CV_BianXiaoyu2025_1.pdf).

I am on the 2025-26 academic job market.

## **“Politics-driven Market Access and Its Cost: Evidence from China’s Grand Canal.”** 
– This study adopts the market access approach in spatial economics, examining the historical case of China’s Grand Canal in the context of national capital relocations from Tang to Qing Dynasties. Using a grid-year level panel data covering the 8th century to 19th century, we find that: (1) The national capital was relocated from central China (the Tang and Song dynasties) to northern China (Yuan, Ming and Qing dynasties), which resulted in the redefinition of the Grand Canal to directly connect the national capital to the prosperous southern China. Specifically, the optimal route to the national capital could predict the actual canal route. (2) It also changed each region’s market access and hence reshaped the economic geography. A 1% increase in market access could lead to a 0.14% increase in population density. (3) Overall, the politics-driven canal construction enhanced the aggregate welfare. Counterfactual analysis shows that removing all canals could lead to a 4% - 11% decrease in total population, which indicates that although the canal route is motivated by political consideration, it still benefits the overall economy.(4) However, it also caused misallocation. If we assume that the Ming and Qing dynasties adopted the Song Dynasty’s canal, a 2.5% - 4% increase in total population is observed.This paper not only examines how politics determines the positioning of transportation networks and consequently regional economic development but also the change of aggregate welfare, allowing us to evaluate the cost of politics-driven transportation networks.


## **“The Retreat of Mammals: Agricultural Expansion, Environment Degradation, and Economic Growth.”** 

– Using a grid-year level panel data from the 16th to 20th centuries, this study documents the correlations between agricultural expansion and environmental degradation, especially identifies the feedback effect of negative environmental externality on economic growth and quantifies the extent to which it offsets the promoting effect of agricultural expansion. We isolate the environmental externality from agricultural expansion by capturing the negative spillover effects caused by adjacent upland reclamation and cultivation. We first show that population density was correlated with fewer mammal species and more land erosion conditions in the Ming-Qing dynasties. We also find that upland populations contribute less to local populations compared to lowland populations, which may be offset by the negative environmental externalities of upland reclamation. 
Then, we take the historical case of widespread maize cultivation in mountainous regions (in the context of intensive population-farmland conflict in the Qing dynasty) as the agricultural expansion shock. We find that: (1) Maize cultivation has a significant negative correlation with the number of mammal species, and a significant positive correlation with historical land erosion measures. (2) Upland maize cultivation significantly reduced local population density, while lowland maize cultivation did not. (3) Notably, the negative environmental externality on population density caused by upland maize cultivation offset around 85% of the positive effects of maize cultivation. (4) The negative environmental externality appeared 50 years after mountain reclamation and persisted for two centuries. (5) As a placebo test, sweet potatoes (widely planted in lowlands such as Guangdong and Guangxi provinces) had no declining effect on population density. (6) Upland maize cultivation has a significant negative effect on other traditional grains (e.g., rice and wheat), suggesting that negative environmental externalities reduced population growth by destroying plain farmland in valleys.
